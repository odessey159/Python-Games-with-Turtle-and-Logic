This repository contains a collection of small games and logic-based applications developed using Python. The projects include both console-based and graphical games built with the Turtle graphics library.

Included games:

A console-based sliding puzzle game that challenges players to solve a 3x3 number puzzle with customized movement keys and real-time move tracking.

A GUI-based animated sliding puzzle built with Turtle, allowing players to interact with a 3x3 to 5x5 tile grid, complete with animations and victory detection.

A Snake game created with Turtle graphics, featuring moving food, monsters, score tracking, and collision detection, offering a complete interactive gaming experience.

These projects demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, object-oriented logic, interactive design, and creative use of graphics libraries.
